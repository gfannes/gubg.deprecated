== Simplify the type encoding with msgpack

* One type of ids, no difference between types and attributes
* top level is always a map
* keys are always ints
* set(), open(range<int>) and close(range<int>) are the only things the user should provide
* try to keep the set/open/close methods outside the populated objects
