= D9 framing

== Features
* Easy to understand
* Easy to implement
* Efficient to implement (think e.g., arduino)
* Low bandwith usage, especially if 0xd9/0xd8 bytes occur infrequent
* Integration with msgpack
** Allows integrated framing and parsing
** No need to buffer frame before parsing
** Benefit of msgpack type info and small binary footprint

== Format
11011001 (0bbbbbbb)* (10bbbbbb) (0xd9-free content)
|-0xd9-| |      flip bits     | |-----------------|

== Examples
* "abc":          0xd9 0x80      0xa3 0x61 0x62 0x63 => 6 bytes
* "\xd9\xd8\xd9": 0xd9 0x85      0xa3 0xd8 0xd8 0xd8 => 6 bytes
* "\xd9"*6:       0xd9 0xbf      0xa7 0xd8*6         => 9 bytes
* "\xd9"*7:       0xd9 0x7f 0x81 0xa7 0xd8*7         => 10 bytes
